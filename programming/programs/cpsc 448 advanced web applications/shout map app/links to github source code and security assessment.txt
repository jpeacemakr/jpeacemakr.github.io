James Peacemaker
CPSC 448 final project

Here are links to the source code on github and the security assessment.

Note that the github source code does not include the environment folder which I have used to store all the usernames, passwords and keys to access firebase and mongoDB.
These should not be made public, but if you want to run it locally, I have included the source code with the environment files in this file upload. 
The back end api mongo.js is in the api folder and can be run with node.
