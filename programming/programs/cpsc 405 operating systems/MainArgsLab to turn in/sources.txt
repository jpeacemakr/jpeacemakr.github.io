I ended up not working with anyone in my group. They blew threw it really fast in the breakout room and I couldn't keep up. I didn't want to slow them down as I am still learning C. I ended up doing it on my own at my own pace.

I used the following websites as a reference for syntax or to learn how some things worked. I did not copy code from them.
